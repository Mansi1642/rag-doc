These nodes represent different data sources or functionalities within the trip planning process.\n\n5. **Visualization**: The graph is visualized using Mermaid, a tool for creating diagrams, which helps in understanding the interactions between different nodes.\n\n6. **Technical Setup**: The project involves setting up environment variables and using command-line tools, as indicated by references to RAM Commands and terminal variables.\n\nIn summary, the Smart Trip Planner is a comprehensive application built using modern tools and technologies, likely leveraging AI and cloud services to provide an enhanced trip planning experience."

It then explains the concept of an AI agent through an example where a user asks about their dog's age. The AI agent processes the query and provides a response, which may be correct or incorrect. This setup illustrates how AI agents interact with a knowledge base to answer user queries."
